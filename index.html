                            History is precious and can teach us a lot about our past. Sometimes, it can even give us a glimpse into the future. With this in mind Chris Harrington, the founder of Westside Storey, took a risk opening a small antique shop in an underdeveloped area with lots of potential. This bustling area known as 17th and Summit, is located in the Westside neighborhood and is creating a stir around the arts district of downtown Kansas City.

                            I have always been impartial to asian cuisine, however I was pleasantly surprised by <a href="http://www.thevietnamcafe.com/">Vietnam Cafe</a> - a modest restaurant with a robust menu located on the fringe of the University of Kansas Medical Center. I ordered pho with beef, a Vietnamese noodle soup consisting of broth, rice noodles and cilantro. Although it took an inconveniently long amount of time for the waitress to take my order, the food was prepared and served quickly. I will definitely be back to try their other offerings.

                            The only palm tree with neon lights you'll find in the metro area is outside of a charming El Salvadorian restaurant in downtown Overland Park. <a href="http://www.downtownop.org/merchant_main.html?id=470&type=0">El Salvadore&ntilde;o's</a> reasonable prices for a hefty portion impressed me on an outing with former co-workers as we stuffed ourselves before heading to The Peanut next door. The authentic food and personable staff makes up for the tacky decor in this Central American restaurant. Make your beverage choice a cup of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horchata">horchata</a>.
